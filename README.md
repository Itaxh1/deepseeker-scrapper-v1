# **DeepSeeker AI v1**  

## **Overview**  

**DeepSeeker AI v1** is an intelligent coding assistant that **fetches relevant answers** from **Stack Overflow** and **Medium**, while also generating AI-powered responses using **DeepSeek RAG**. This tool is designed to help developers quickly find high-quality coding solutions with minimal effort.  

## **Features**  

### **1. AI-Powered Code Assistance**  
- Uses **DeepSeek RAG** to generate intelligent coding responses.  
- Enhances answer quality using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  

### **2. Stack Overflow & Medium Search**  
- Fetches **top-ranked** Stack Overflow answers for relevant queries.  
- Provides a **direct Medium search link** for blog-based solutions.  

### **3. Optimized Query Processing**  
- Generates a **refined search query** to improve answer accuracy.  
- Implements **caching and query optimization** for faster responses.  

## **Tech Stack**  

- **Python** (for backend processing)  
- **Streamlit** (for UI and interactive chat)  
- **DeepSeek RAG** (for AI-generated answers)  
- **Requests & BeautifulSoup** (for data fetching)  

## **Installation**  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepseeker-ai.git
   cd deepseeker-ai
   ```  
2. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

## **Usage**  

1. **Run the application**:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py 
   ```  

## **Output**  

- AI-generated responses are displayed in a **chat-like interface**.  
- Stack Overflow answers are fetched and formatted dynamically.  
- A Medium search link is provided for additional insights.  

## **Future Improvements**  

- Implement **multi-threading** for faster response fetching.  
- Extend support for **additional programming forums**.  
- Optimize AI-generated responses with **custom fine-tuning**.
