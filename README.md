# DeepSeeker Scraper v1  

## Overview  

**DeepSeeker Scraper v1** is a web scraping tool designed to extract coding-related Q&A data from platforms like **Quora and Stack Overflow**. This scraper utilizes **Selenium** for dynamic content extraction and **DeepSeek RAG** for AI-powered response generation, enabling efficient query resolution for developers.  

## Features  

- **Web Scraping with Selenium**  
  - Extracts Q&A content from **Quora** dynamically.  
  - Retrieves structured data from **Stack Overflow** for better query processing.  

- **AI-Powered Responses with DeepSeek RAG**  
  - Generates intelligent responses based on extracted data.  
  - Enhances answer quality using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  

- **Efficient Data Processing**  
  - Stores extracted data in a structured format (JSON/Database).  
  - Implements caching and optimization for faster queries.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Python** (for scripting and automation)  
- **Selenium** (for web scraping)  
- **DeepSeek RAG** (for AI-generated responses)  
- **BeautifulSoup** (for HTML parsing)  
- **SQLite/MySQL** (for structured data storage)  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepseeker-scrapper-v1.git
   cd deepseeker-scrapper-v1
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Set up Selenium WebDriver:  
   - Download the appropriate **WebDriver** for your browser (Chrome/Firefox).  
   - Place it in the project directory or add it to the system path.  

## Usage  

1. Run the scraper for Quora:  
   ```bash
   python quora_scraper.py
   ```  
2. Run the scraper for Stack Overflow:  
   ```bash
   python stackoverflow_scraper.py
   ```  
3. Process the extracted data using DeepSeek RAG:  
   ```bash
   python deepseek_processor.py
   ```  

## Output  

- Scraped data is stored in `data/` as JSON or in a configured database.  
- AI-processed responses are saved in `processed_data/`.  

## Future Improvements  

- Implement multi-threading for faster scraping.  
- Add support for additional knowledge sources.  
- Optimize AI-generated responses with fine-tuned models.
